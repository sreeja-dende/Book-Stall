   <h1>🏗️ Civil Engineering  🌉</h1>
   <p><h2 style="color:white">**Civil Engineering** is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment. This includes structures like buildings, roads, bridges, dams, and water systems.<br><br>  

### 🏗️ **Core Subjects in Civil Engineering:**<br><br> 

1. **Engineering Mechanics:**  <br><br> 
   - Fundamental concepts of forces, moments, and equilibrium — the base for structural analysis.<br><br>   

2. **Strength of Materials (SOM):**  <br><br> 
   - Stress, strain, bending, and torsion — understanding how materials behave under various forces. <br><br>  

3. **Structural Analysis:**  <br><br> 
   - Analysis of trusses, beams, and frames to ensure stability and safety.<br><br>   

4. **Building Materials and Construction:**  <br><br> 
   - Study of materials like concrete, steel, wood, and bricks — and construction techniques. <br><br>  

5. **Geotechnical Engineering (Soil Mechanics):**  <br><br> 
   - Soil properties, foundations, and earth-retaining structures.  <br><br> 

6. **Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics:**  <br><br> 
   - Study of fluid properties, flow behavior, and hydraulic structures like dams and canals.<br><br>   

7. **Transportation Engineering:**  <br><br> 
   - Design and maintenance of roads, highways, railways, airports, and traffic systems. <br><br>  

8. **Environmental Engineering:**  <br><br> 
   - Water treatment, sewage disposal, and pollution control — ensuring eco-friendly designs. <br><br>  

9. **Surveying:**  <br><br> 
   - Land surveying techniques using instruments like theodolites, GPS, and total stations.  <br><br> 

10. **Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures (RCC):**  <br><br> 
    - Designing concrete beams, slabs, and columns using reinforced bars.<br><br>   

11. **Steel Structures:**  <br><br> 
    - Designing steel frames, trusses, and industrial buildings. <br><br>  

12. **Construction Project Management:**  <br><br> 
    - Planning, scheduling (using tools like CPM/PERT), and managing resources for projects.  <br><br>
