   <h1>⚡Electrical and Electronics Engineering⚡</h1>
   <p><h2 style="color:white">**Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE)** focuses on the study of electrical systems, electronic devices, and electromagnetism. It combines core electrical concepts with modern electronics, making it a versatile branch of engineering. <br><br> 

### ⚡ **Core Subjects in EEE:**<br><br> 

1. **Electrical Circuits and Networks:**  <br><br> 
   - Kirchhoff's laws, network theorems, and circuit analysis. <br><br>  

2. **Electromagnetic Field Theory:**  <br><br> 
   - Electric and magnetic fields, Maxwell's equations, and wave propagation. <br><br>  

3. **Electrical Machines:**  <br><br> 
   - DC machines, transformers, synchronous and induction machines — essential for power generation and motors.<br><br>   

4. **Power Systems:**  <br><br> 
   - Generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power, including grid systems.  <br><br> 

5. **Control Systems:**  <br><br> 
   - Feedback systems, PID controllers, and stability analysis. <br><br>  

6. **Power Electronics:**  <br><br> 
   - Semiconductor devices like SCR, MOSFETs, and IGBTs used for power conversion. <br><br>  

7. **Analog and Digital Electronics:**<br><br>   
   - Op-amps, logic gates, flip-flops, and microprocessors — similar to ECE but with a focus on power applications. <br><br>  

8. **Signals and Systems:**  <br><br> 
   - Time and frequency domain analysis, Fourier transforms, and system responses.<br><br>   

9. **Microprocessors and Microcontrollers:**  <br><br> 
   - 8085, 8051, and their applications in embedded systems.  <br><br> 

10. **Renewable Energy Systems:**  <br><br> 
   - Solar, wind, and other sustainable energy sources and their integration into the grid. <br><br>
