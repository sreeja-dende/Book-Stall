   <h1>üîßMechanical Engineering‚öôÔ∏è</h1>
   <p><h2 style="color:white">**Mechanical Engineering (Mech)** is one of the oldest and broadest branches of engineering, focusing on the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It combines principles of physics, mathematics, and material science to develop machinery and tools. <br><br> 

### üîß **Core Subjects in Mechanical Engineering:**<br><br>

1. **Engineering Mechanics:**  <br><br>
   - Newtonian mechanics, statics, dynamics, and kinematics of particles and rigid bodies.  <br><br>

2. **Strength of Materials (SOM):**  <br><br>
   - Stress, strain, bending, torsion, and elasticity concepts to understand material behavior under loads.<br><br>  

3. **Thermodynamics:**<br><br>  
   - Laws of thermodynamics, heat transfer, entropy, and thermodynamic cycles like Otto and Diesel cycles. <br><br> 

4. **Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines:**  <br><br>
   - Fluid properties, Bernoulli's principle, Navier-Stokes equations, pumps, turbines, and compressors.  <br><br>

5. **Manufacturing Technology:**  <br><br>
   - Metal casting, welding, machining processes (turning, milling), and CNC machining.<br><br>  

6. **Machine Design:**  <br><br>
   - Design of gears, springs, shafts, and bearings ‚Äî considering strength, safety, and functionality. <br><br> 

7. **Heat and Mass Transfer:**  <br><br>
   - Conduction, convection, radiation, and heat exchanger design. <br><br> 

8. **Theory of Machines (TOM):**  <br><br>
   - Kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms ‚Äî gears, cams, and linkages. <br><br> 

9. **Automobile Engineering:**  <br><br>
   - Internal combustion engines (IC engines), transmission systems, and vehicle dynamics. <br><br> 

10. **Robotics and Automation:**  <br><br>
   - Introduction to robotic kinematics, sensors, actuators, and control systems.  <br><br>
