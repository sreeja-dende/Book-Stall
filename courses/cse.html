   <h1>Computer Science Engineering</h1>
   <p><h2 style="color:white">**Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** is a dynamic field that combines computer science and electrical engineering principles to design, develop, and maintain software and hardware systems. It’s all about solving real-world problems using technology! <br> 

Here’s a quick breakdown of what CSE typically covers:  
<br><br>
### 🌟 **Core Subjects:**<br>
1. **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Java, Python, etc.<br>  
2. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):** Essential for problem-solving and efficient coding. <br> 
3. **Computer Networks:** How data is transmitted over networks — like the internet.  <br>
4. **Operating Systems (OS):** Concepts like process management, memory management, and file systems.  <br>
5. **Databases (DBMS):** Managing and retrieving data using SQL and NoSQL. <br> 
6. **Software Engineering:** Designing, testing, and maintaining software applications.  <br>
7. **Theory of Computation:** Mathematical models of computation — automata, Turing machines, etc.  <br><br>
